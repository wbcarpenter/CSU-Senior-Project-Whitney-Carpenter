Project Description
-------------------

The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly Chrome extension that evaluates the strength of passwords.  The extension will provide instant feedback on the security level of passwords entered by users, including criteria such as length, complexity, and entropy.  It will offer suggestions to enhance password strength after analyzing the complexity of the password entered.  To ensure privacy and security, all password evaluations will be performed locally within the extension, and no information will leave the extension.  The project will involve researching password security standards, designing an intuitive user interface, and conducting thorough testing to ensure functionality across different platforms.
