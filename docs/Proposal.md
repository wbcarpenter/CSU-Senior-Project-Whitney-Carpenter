Problem Statement
-----------------

A user-friendly extension to evaluate password strength and provide instant feedback will enhance online security and protect user privacy. Ideally, users would create strong, complex passwords adhering to the highest security standards; however, many struggle with this, opting for simple, reused passwords. This is a critical issue as weak passwords create significant security risks, including hacking attempts, data breaches, and identity theft, potentially leading to financial loss, privacy invasion, and reputational damage. According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report¹, 81% of hacking-related breaches involve compromised and weak passwords. Using a user-friendly Chrome extension to evaluate password strength will significantly mitigate these risks.  Users stand to benefit substantially from this extension in the form of enhanced security and the support of their right to privacy.  Weak passwords are a major security risk that can lead to significant consequences, but by developing a user-friendly Chrome extension that evaluates password strength and provides instant, local feedback, we can help users create stronger passwords, enhance their online security, and protect their privacy.

Project Description
-------------------

The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly Chrome extension that evaluates the strength of passwords.  The extension will provide instant feedback on the security level of passwords entered by users, including criteria such as length, complexity, and entropy.  It will offer suggestions to enhance password strength after analyzing the complexity of the password entered.  To ensure privacy and security, all password evaluations will be performed locally within the extension, and no information will leave the extension.  The project will involve researching password security standards, designing an intuitive user interface, and conducting thorough testing to ensure functionality across different platforms.

Personal Motivation
-------------------

Developing a user-friendly password evaluation extension is very important to me because cybersecurity is a field that directly impacts everyone's privacy and security in the digital world.  Weak passwords are one of the most common vulnerabilities that lead to security breaches, and I have seen firsthand that many users struggle with creating strong passwords due to a lack of guidance and instruction.  By designing this Chrome extension, I aim to bridge this gap by providing an accessible and effective tool tha helps users develop stronger passwords.  This project aligns with my passion for cybersecurity and desire to help others that are not in this field to have access to practical security solutions.  

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

1. Password Security Standards  
    - I will study the NIST guidelines and other best practices for password security.  
    - I will research commonly used password strength metrics, including entropy calculations and complexity requirements.  
2. Chrome Extension Development  
    - I will learn how to build a Chrome extension using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
    - I will research how to integrate the Chrome Extensions API for real-time interaction with password fields.  
    - I will research best practices for UI/UX design to ensure the extension is effective.  
3. Ensuring Security and Privacy  
    - I will do research to figure out all the measures I will take to ensure all password evaluations occur locally without storing or transmitting data.  
    - I will research potential security risks associated with browser extensions and mitigate vulnerabilities.
