Problem Statement
-----------------

A user-friendly extension to evaluate password strength and provide instant feedback will enhance online security and protect user privacy. Ideally, users would create strong, complex passwords adhering to the highest security standards; however, many struggle with this, opting for simple, reused passwords. This is a critical issue as weak passwords create significant security risks, including hacking attempts, data breaches, and identity theft, potentially leading to financial loss, privacy invasion, and reputational damage. According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report¹, 81% of hacking-related breaches involve compromised and weak passwords. Using a user-friendly Chrome extension to evaluate password strength will significantly mitigate these risks.  Users stand to benefit substantially from this extension in the form of enhanced security and the support of their right to privacy.  Weak passwords are a major security risk that can lead to significant consequences, but by developing a user-friendly Chrome extension that evaluates password strength and provides instant, local feedback, we can help users create stronger passwords, enhance their online security, and protect their privacy.

Project Description
-------------------

The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly Chrome extension that evaluates the strength of passwords.  The extension will provide instant feedback on the security level of passwords entered by users, including criteria such as length, complexity, and entropy.  It will offer suggestions to enhance password strength after analyzing the complexity of the password entered.  To ensure privacy and security, all password evaluations will be performed locally within the extension, and no information will leave the extension.  The project will involve researching password security standards, designing an intuitive user interface, and conducting thorough testing to ensure functionality across different platforms.
