## IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION

### **Product**
**Product Name:** SecurePass

### **Project Description:**
SecurePass is a Chrome browser extension designed to evaluate password strength and provide users with instant, local feedback.  It assesses password length, complexity, and entropy, offering real-time suggestions to help users create stronger passwords.  All password evaluations occur locally, ensuring complete privacy and data security.

---

## TESTING OBJECTIVES
The objective of this test plan is to verify that SecurePass meets all defined requirements established in the Requirements Document.  Testing will ensure:
- Password strength evaluation functions correctly and consistently
- Feedback is provided in real-time without noticable delay
- No password data is transmitted or stored externally
- The user interface is clear, accesible, and functional across devices

## UNIT TEST

### **UNIT TEST STRATEGY / EXTENT OF UNIT TESTING**
Unit testing will verify the correct behavior of individual components such as: 
- Password strength evaluation algorithm
- Feedback rendering module
- Suggestion generation function

**Test Environment:**
**Hardware:** Windows 10 / 11 PC, 8GB RAM minimum
**Software:** Chrome Browser (latest version), Visual Studio Code, Node.js
**Network:** Local environment, offline tests where possible

---

### **UNIT TEST CASES**

| # | Objective | Input | Expected Results | Test Deliverables |
|---|-----------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Verify weak password detection | "password123" | Rated as Weak | Unit test report |
| 2 | Verfiy strong password detection | "L!m@x#9Qz2" | Rated as Strong | Unit test report |
| 3 | Check suggestion display | "123456" | Displays suggestions for improvement | Unit test report |
| 4 | Confirm no network calls | Random passwords | No network activity recorded | Browser dev tools log |

---

### **Regression Test Cases**

| # | Objective | Input | Expected Results | Observed |
|---|-----------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Verify previously working strength evaluation | "Secure123!" | Displays consistent "Medium" rating | TBD |
| 2 | Check UI remains responsive | User enters password quickly | Feedback updates smoothly | TBD |

---

## INTEGRATION TEST

### **Integration Test Strategy and Extent of Integration Testing**
Integration testing ensures that the extension modules interact correctly with each other and with the Chrome environment (e.g., detecting password fields, displaying overlay feedback).

### **Integration Test Cases**

| # | Objective | Input | Expected Results | Test Deliverables |
|---|-----------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Verify Chrome API integration | Password field detected | Feedback overlay appears | Integration report |
| 2 | Test interaction between UI and algorithm | "StrongPass!23" | Correct strength and suggestions displayed | Integration report |
| 3 | Confirm extension remains active during standard browser use | Perform typical browser activities | The extension remains available until Chrome closes or updates | Test observation notes |

---

## USER-ACCEPTANCE TEST (UAT)

### **User-Acceptance Test Strategy***
User-Acceptance Testing (UAT) will involve a group of 5-10 users (non-technical and cybersecurity students) testing the extension for clarity, speed, and usability.
Methods:
- Observation and feedback survey
- Task-based testing (create passwords, interpret feedback)
- Post-test questionnaire (Likert scale for usability and understanding)

---

### **User-Acceptance Test Cases**

| # | Test Item | Expected Results | Actual Results | Date |
|---|-----------|------------------|----------------|------|
| 1 | Evaluate clarity of feedback | 90% of users understand feedback without guidance | TBD | TBD |
| 2 | Evaluate educational tips | 90% of users report increased awareness of password security | TBD | TBD |
| 3 | Test installation ease | Installed and functional within 2 minutes | TBD | TBD |
